Community Manager NW_Mugsy responded to a recent thread in which players state that players \u201cmass reporting\u201d the enemy faction to have them banned prior to a territory-deciding conflict. According to Mugsy, \u201cit shouldn\u2019t matter how many reports\u201d are received about a player if they haven\u2019t broken the Code of Conduct as a human reviews the reports and bans based on behavior.</p>\r\n<p>In the post, the CM goes on to note that what is generally occurring is that two groups are baiting each other in attempts to get them to say something that is ban-worthy and then report each other. The increased number of reports only moves the reported individuals up in the review queue. The moderator does the rest of the work from there.</p>\r\n<p>Two caveats that were made in the post are that there may be some confusion with the ban notices being \u201ctoo vague\u201d and the banned individual just not remembering or realizing what they did, and that there are cases of \u201chuman error\u201d. For the latter, it\u2019s advised that players submit an appeal.</p>\r\n<p>This isn\u2019t the only thing the New World team has addressed over the last day or so. The team has also dropped posts addressing changes designed to improve <a title=\"New World Combat Responsiveness\" href=\"https://forums.newworld.com/t/dev-blog-combat-responsiveness/526907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">combat responsiveness</a>, the \u2013 still in the works \u2013 <a title=\"New World Server Transfers\" href=\"https://forums.newworld.com/t/megathread-gauging-interest-for-regional-server-transfer/526619/3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">server transfers</a>, and <a title=\"New World Family Sharing\" href=\"https://forums.newworld.com/t/notice-family-sharing-update/509393\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">family sharing</a>.

After an unexpected reunion with an old friend, Cassidy considers that maybe Overwatch needs more than the old crew to give it new life.</em></p>\r\n<p>The first chapter of the comic is available for free reading or downloading <a href=\"https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/media/stories/new-blood-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on the Overwatch site</a>, along with the first chapter of a text story, titled <a href=\"https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/media/stories/deadlock-rebels-chapter-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deadlock Rebels</a>, which -- if you can judge a book by its cover -- seemes to cover the (mis)adventures of a young Cassidy and Ashe.</p>\r\n<p>Related to the comic is the in-game event is Cassidy's New Blood Challenge, which runs from today until November 23.

Players planning to take part will need to create a new character on one of the eight available servers and Blizzard is offering the opportunity to do so in advance. On November 11, players can select one of the servers listed in <a title=\"World of Warcraft Season of Mastery Character Creation Post\" href=\"https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/season-of-mastery-name-reservation-details/1130359\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the post on the Blizzard forums</a> and reserve their name. There are, of course, some rules.</p>\r\n<p>The most important thing to keep in mind is that players will only be able to reserve a name for one character on their account. Of course, you\u2019ll just go ahead and create your character at the same time, so it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that if you decide you don\u2019t like something about it, you\u2019ll have to delete the character in question and start over. (Might just be a really good idea to make sure you\u2019re happy before saving, so you don\u2019t end up risking losing the name to someone else.)</p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that each of the eight available realms does have a player number cap and once it\u2019s full, you\u2019ll have to select another. If you know what server you want, don\u2019t wait until the last minute to create your character.</p>",

Featuring a variety of game elements, Dysterra is a large-scale online survival crafting game in which players fight over a highly-desired mineral, Terrasite. Features of the game include building bases and obtaining landmarks in various regions that allow them to control the climate \u2013 meaning they can bring on their own natural disasters to mess with other players.</p>\r\n<p>Players also participate in FPS combat using both melee weapons and firearms. To obtain better weapons, they\u2019ll also need to build research facilities to produce them, and they\u2019ll definitely want the better weapons as Terrasite is not the only thing they\u2019ll be fighting over. There are also valuable supply drops necessary to survival.</p>\r\n<p>As noted on Steam, Dysterra is still a work in progress and has no predicted launch date. That said, the game is listed on Steam and those wanting to participate in testing will need to <a title=\"Dysterra Steam Page\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527890/Dysterra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">request access via the game\u2019s page</a>. The upcoming beta test will run for seven days, from November 15 to November 22.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lgm65hAbpGk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p>",

In Norway, we have legislated 20 days vacation no matter what, and if you're on tariff you have 25 days. Paid. Certain companies have 4x3 sick days a year.

Today, the company launched the fourth and final quadrant for 2021 \u2013 titled \u201cNew Dawn\u201d. Each Quadrant focuses on improving something different in the game. For instance, when <a title=\"Eve Online Quadrant 3 Gateway\" href=\"../news/eve-online-quadrant-3-gateway-update-adds-new-new-player-experience\">Quadrant 3: Gateway</a> launched in September, it focused on improving the new and returning player experience \u2013 implementing things like tutorials on how to pilot ships. For the fourth Quadrant, CCP is focusing on improving the game\u2019s economy with changes to mining, compression, and resources.</p>\r\n<p>As noted in the blog post on the Eve Online site, CCP has already done some work toward improving the distribution of resources in the game and even changed how ships relying on those resources to be made are manufactured. Now, New Dawn will increase resources throughout New Eden, updating the game\u2019s mining system and rebalancing mining ships.</p>\r\n<p>The update doesn\u2019t just concentrate on the economic aspect, however. It also adds four new exploration sites intended to reward those brave enough to venture into the most dangerous parts of space. Those willing to do so, and who manage to do so successfully, will fly away with capital and supercapital construction components. Obtaining these items will require players to explore three different AEGIS facilities and the Overmind Nursery Grove sites. Descriptions of each of these areas, as well as more details on the other changes, can be found on the <a title=\"Eve Online Quadrant 4 Blog Post\" href=\"https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/new-dawn-new-quadrant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eve Online blog</a>.</p>",

Mobile revenue, in particular, took a big hit, dropping 44% year-over-year. To make up for that \"PC revenues exceeded the expected range and mobile revenues came within the expected range\" -- we were <em>planning </em>to have a down quarter, you see?</p>\r\n<p>Most of the rest of the financials follow the usual trends we've seen from Nexon -- up here, down there, planning for a good Q4, etc. But perhaps the most surprising nugget of info is some slightly more tangible info about what Patrick S\u00f6derlund's Embark Studios is up to. You might recall that <a href=\"../news/nexon-fully-acquire-patrick-soderlunds-embark-studios\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nexon acquired</a> the former EA executive's Swedish studio two years ago, but we've heard little from the studio apart from a few high-level dev blogs <a href=\"../news/patrick-soderlunds-embark-studios-working-cooperative-f2p-action-game-set-distant-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like this one</a>, that described its product as\u00a0\"a cooperative free-to-play action game set in a distant future.\"</p>\r\n<p>The financial report includes pieces of art from three of \"Embark's New Games In Development.\" These fall under the temporary titles of \"Codename: Pioneer,\" \"Codename: Discovery,\" and something just called \"Creative Platform.\" In addition to the co-op F2P action game, we also know that Embark is working on a PvP shooter, <a href=\"https://medium.com/embarkstudios/our-continued-journey-89dad7a76bff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described on the company's site</a> as \"a concept that leans heavily into team-based gameplay and puts dynamism, physicality, and destruction front and center.\" I'd guess that's Discovery, while the earlier announced game is Pioneer.</p>\r\n<p>As for the company's \"Creative Platform,\" Embark's talked about that from time to time as well, with the previously linked blog piece comparing it to Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite creative mode, and Rust. That blog was from late 2020, and there have been a slew of player-generated content games to show up since then, many utilizing some form of blockchain or NFTs. We haven't heard a proper update from Embark <a href=\"https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">since February</a>, but we'd guess that some end-of-year update could be in the cards over the next few weeks.</p>\r\n<p>You can view Nexon's financials <a href=\"https://company.nexon.co.jp/en/press/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">via the company's investor relations page</a>.</p>",

Now anyone can try the game for free for 10 days and, if they like it, purchase the title at its new $14.99 price point. The game was priced at $39.99 at launch in July, which was itself a drop from a previously announced $49.99 price tag. Players who purchased the game up to 60 days before the price drop will receive 3,000 Crowns, the game's premium currency, as a bonus.</p>\r\n<p>The price drop arrives alongside a new patch that offers an enhanced new player experience and makes it easier for smaller guilds to be a factor in PvP. Guilds of 20-50 can now siege and hold forts without being overrun by bigger guilds, while guilds with 10-25 members can hold smaller outposts. Executive Producer Gordon Walton said that while Crowfall was designed with \"large-scale PVP siege combat as the focus ... there are other groups of players who want to be able to play with their smaller guilds and not get obliterated.\" Who knew?</p>\r\n<p>The patch also added several quality-of-life improvements, as well as the return of the \"Decapathon\" event, where players can sacrifice the heads of other players they defeat in PvP. Fun as that sounds, the rapid drops in price, along with the <a href=\"../news/crowfall-dev-artcraft-confirms-layoffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent layoffs</a> and the new free mode being implemented -- along with <a href=\"https://crowfall.com/en-US/news/articles/Crow-Recruits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">greater bonuses to the recruiting program</a> -- to try and boost player numbers, lead me to think that it's Crowfall itself that might be getting its head chopped off soon.</p>",

Beginning with STO, Cryptic is preparing for their next content release and, to get players ready, they\u2019re hosting a special event from November 16 to December 7. <a title=\"Star Trek Online The Battle for Qo'noS\" href=\"https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11501763-the-battle-for-qo'nos!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Battle for Qo\u2019noS event</a> is the final event for Campaign 3 and will offer players not only honor but also the chance at the new Console \u2013 Universal \u2013 Aakar\u2019s Vengeance. It being the last part of Event Campaign 3 also means that it\u2019s the last chance players will have to work toward the Tier 6 Infinity Promotion or Infinity Lock Box Ship.</p>\r\n<p>To earn progress, players will need to participate in one of three TFOs: Remain Klingon, To Hell with Honor, and Best Served Cold. Progress points are available for completing one TFO each day. Accumulating 14 points will earn players Aakar\u2019s Vengeance, after which, players who continue to complete these three TFOs will be rewarded with Dilithium.</p>\r\n<p>In Neverwinter news, players can now <a title=\"Neverwinter Unbind Tokens\" href=\"https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/11501733-unbind-tokens!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">purchase Unbind Tokens</a> from the Zen Market. These have already been available in the game as a preview or as premium rewards over the last week and are used to unbind bound items. As noted in the post on the Neverwinter site, only a limited selection of items can currently be unbound, but the number will expand as time goes on. The number of tokens required to unbind an item will vary. If you want to do a little unbinding, check to see how many tokens you\u2019re going to need first.</p>",

That system, along with things like loot boxes, aren\u2019t exactly designed to benefit the player and often end up making players feel stressed and generally bad about something that should be a good time.</p>\r\n<p>As it turns out, 343 Industries seems to have the same feeling about both these methods of monetization and, while they are going to have battle passes, they\u2019re definitely going to be different. The game won\u2019t have loot boxes either...which should be a nice change. They recently <a title=\"IGN - Halo Infinite Battle Pass\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-multiplayer-battle-pass-season-one-plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spoke to IGN</a> about their plans for Halo Infinite battle passes, and it sounds pretty nice \u2013 if they stick to it.</p>\r\n<p>Rather than having battle passes that expire when the next one comes out, 343 Industries will instead allow players to complete the battle passes at their leisure. Yes, new ones will come up and you\u2019ll have to buy them each time, but once you have them, they\u2019re yours and you can work on them as you please, with some stipulations. The biggest of these is that no matter how many battle passes you have that need working on, you can only do one at a time. However, you get to decide which one is active and you can switch whenever you like.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, approximately every quarter of the battle pass will offer a legendary cosmetic. Event rewards will not be tied to the battle pass. The game will also offer players cosmetic or customization options as rewards simply for playing the campaign and completing weekly challenges.</p>",

In doing so, however, the Far Cry and Assassin's Creed developer might have only created further discord among its staff members.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-announces-pay-raises-to-stop-developers-from-le-1848012438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kotaku is reporting</a> that the company has implemented pay raises across the board at its Canadian studios,\u00a0\"to combat an exodus by many of its most senior developers.\" The studios, based in Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto, Chicoutimi, Halifax, and Winnipeg, are responsible for the development of Ubisoft's biggest titles. The raises amount to 5% to 7% for junior staff, while those in more senior positions will receive up to a 20% increase. Employees will also receive more vacation days and better pay during parental leave.</p>\r\n<p>While appearing to be a generous gesture on the surface, the difference in pay rate has struck many, including the voices behind the A Better Ubisoft initiative, as less than satisfactory. \"By weighting the pay rises enormously in favor of senior staff, management are exacerbating the gap between the highly and low paid workers,\" a spokesperson for the group said, saying that the move does \"absolutely nothing\" to address their grievances, which were re-iterated late last week:</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"und\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ABetterUbisoft?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ABetterUbisoft</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndAbuseInGaming?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EndAbuseInGaming</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/KtcPHAWq57\">pic.twitter.com/KtcPHAWq57</a></p>\r\n\u2014 ABetterUbisoft (@ABetterUbisoft) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABetterUbisoft/status/1456579853222875145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 5, 2021</a></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n<script src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Ubisoft billed the changes as being prompted by the increased cost of living in Canada. It was the first time the company had made such a mid-year adjustment, which further lends credence to the notion that it's \"desperately trying to hold on to what few experienced devs are still here,\" as one dev in a Canadian studio put it.</p>",
